This passion project started due to a feeling I have always had, a feeling that would bubble in conversations and make its way into my thoughts constantly. That feeling was obsession. 
	<br>Being obsessed with something usually means that you spend time, energy and effort becoming more and more familiar with it. 
The problem was the obsession never stuck. I couldn’t commit to a single obsession. I was torn from subject to subject, movies and shows, books and music. A cartoon could become my personality for weeks, despite my better judgment. 
Accepting this frivolous part of me gave me an opportunity, a chance to draw parallels between the things that I loved. I would measure, compare and analyze the mediums that made me feel a tangible amount of passion and I would share that passion with whoever would listen. 
<br>I found like minded individuals, people who would analyze and critique even the things they held dear, we would talk and debate about themes and execution until we had a basis to approach a rating. 
<br>Articulation is a gift, learning how to express yourself accurately and emphatically is a process. Speaking came easy, but writing was a hurdle that must be jumped every few meters. 
<br>Hopefully the articles you find here are well written, creative and insightful. If you find something you like, or possibly a new obsession, be sure to make your way back. 
We hope to foster a community filled with love, appreciation and understanding. Respectfully, Authors.
